## Weekly Opening Range

- **Monday's range defines the Weekly Opening Range** (high and low for entire week)
- Tuesday may extend that range - could be false break, range extension, reversal, or inside day
- **By end of Tuesday, weekly high or low is typically set** - one often holds, the other may break

### Tuesday Scenarios (after Monday's Opening Range)

1. **Breakout and Trend** - Opening range breaks and trends
2. **False Breakout** - Breaks opening range then reverses back inside (stop hunt)
3. **Inside Day** - Trades between Monday's high and low

### Wednesday Analysis

Check:
- Did Monday or Tuesday close as inside day?
- Did Tuesday's breakout fail?
- Did Tuesday close outside or inside Monday's range?
- Was Tuesday a First Red Day (FRD) or First Green Day (FGD)?
- Has there been 3 levels of rise/fall from HOW/LOW?

Key observations:
- Tuesday closes outside Monday's range → Wednesday trend continuation probability rises
- Tuesday breakout fails (closes inside Monday's range) → high probability of reaching other end of range
- Both Monday and Tuesday breakouts fail at opposite ends → **Wednesday has high parabolic trend potential**
- Three pushes out of Weekly Opening Range by Friday → significant reversal potential
- Only two drives out by Friday → Parabolic Trend Trade more probable

### Range Extensions

- Tuesday-Friday range extension = **0.5 to 5x Monday's range**
- Average Weekly Range = **1.8 to 2.3x Average Daily Range**

## Using Profiles Effectively

1. **Anchor to Higher-Timeframe Trend** - Trade profiles aligned with dominant trend
2. **Pair with Confirmation** - Validate using indicators, candlesticks, liquidity arrays, macro data
3. **Risk Management** - Disciplined stop-loss, logical invalidation points, appropriate sizing
4. **Economic Calendar** - Profiles "practically useless" without accounting for macro events
