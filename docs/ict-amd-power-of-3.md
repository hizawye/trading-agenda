# ICT Power of 3: AMD (Accumulation - Manipulation - Distribution)

Source: Michael J. Huddleston via time-price-research-astrofin.blogspot.com

## Core Concept

Markets move in three phases orchestrated by institutional traders ("smart money"):

1. **Accumulation** - Building positions
2. **Manipulation** - False move to trap retail (Judas Swing)
3. **Distribution** - True directional move

## Extended Model: AMXD

Some models expand to four phases:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Accumulation | Range-bound, position building |
| Manipulation | False breakout, stop hunt |
| Expansion | True directional move |
| Distribution | Profit-taking, reversal setup |

## Fractal Application

AMD applies across all timeframes:

### Yearly
- Q1 (Jan-Mar): Accumulation
- Q2 (Apr-Jun): Manipulation
- Q3 (Jul-Sep): Distribution
- Q4 (Oct-Dec): Continuation/Reversal

### Weekly
- Monday: Accumulation (sets range)
- Tuesday: Manipulation (Judas day)
- Wednesday: Distribution (true move)
- Thursday: Continuation
- Friday: Profit-taking

### Daily
- Asia (18:00-00:00): Accumulation
- London (00:00-06:00): Manipulation
- NY AM (06:00-12:00): Distribution
- NY PM (12:00-18:00): Continuation/Reversal

### Session (90 min)
- First 22.5 min: Accumulation
- Second 22.5 min: Manipulation
- Third 22.5 min: Distribution
- Fourth 22.5 min: X (continuation or reversal)

## Market Maker Footprints

Institutional activity leaves detectable patterns:
- Order blocks
- Liquidity pools
- Fair value gaps
- Breaker blocks

Markets are "under complete and utter control and manipulation" - **price moves to where the money is**.

## Trading Application

### Bullish AMD
1. Accumulation: Range forms above key support
2. Manipulation: False breakdown below support (stop hunt)
3. Distribution: Rally to target

### Bearish AMD
1. Accumulation: Range forms below key resistance
2. Manipulation: False breakout above resistance (stop hunt)
3. Distribution: Decline to target

## Key Insight

Understanding AMD helps identify:
- When NOT to trade (during manipulation)
- Optimal entries (after manipulation, at start of distribution)
- Stop placement (beyond manipulation zone)
