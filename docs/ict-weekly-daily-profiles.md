## CBDR (Central Bank Dealers Range)

**Time**: 2:00 PM - 8:00 PM EST (previous day)

### Usage
1. Mark CBDR high and low
2. Measure range size (should be < 40 pips for FX)
3. Add CBDR projections:
   - 1x CBDR above high = target
   - 1x CBDR below low = target
4. Price typically sweeps one side before reversing

### CBDR + Asian Range
```
CBDR (2PM-8PM) → Asian (8PM-12AM) → London (12AM+)
   [Range 1]        [Range 2]         [Expansion]
```
