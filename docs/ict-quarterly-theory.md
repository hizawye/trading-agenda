## Core Concept

**Time must be divided into quarters for proper interpretation of market cycles.**

This is fractal - applies to yearly, monthly, weekly, daily, and session timeframes.

## Two Primary Patterns

### AMD-X Pattern
| Quarter | Phase | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Q1 | Accumulation | Consolidation |
| Q2 | Manipulation | Judas Swing |
| Q3 | Distribution | True move |
| Q4 | X | Continuation or Reversal |

### X-AMD Pattern
| Quarter | Phase | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Q1 | X | Continuation or Reversal |
| Q2 | Accumulation | Consolidation |
| Q3 | Manipulation | Judas Swing |
| Q4 | Distribution | True move |

## Weekly Cycle Structure

**Four quarters, each one day long (Monday-Thursday)**

| Quarter | Day | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Q1 | Monday | Sets the tone, dictates following quarters |
| Q2 | Tuesday | Contains the "True Open" |
| Q3 | Wednesday | |
| Q4 | Thursday | |

**Friday is NOT included** - has its own specific function (profit-taking, reversal, retracement)

### Weekly True Open
- **18:00 EST every Monday**
- Trading strategy: Buy below true open when bullish, sell above when bearish

### Q1 Function
- Q1 dictates the quarters that follow
- Acts as a barometer
- If Q1 is overextended → expect Q2 to consolidate

## Daily Cycle Structure

**Four 6-hour quarters**

| Quarter | Time (EST) | Session |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Q1 | 18:00 - 00:00 | Asia |
| Q2 | 00:00 - 06:00 | London |
| Q3 | 06:00 - 12:00 | NY AM |
| Q4 | 12:00 - 18:00 | NY PM |

### Daily True Open
- **Midnight EST (00:00)**

---

## Session Quarters (90 minutes each)

Each 6-hour session divides into four 90-minute quarters.

### True Opens by Session
| Session | True Open (EST) |
|---------|-----------------|
| Asian | 19:30 |
| London | 01:30 |
| NY AM | 07:30 |
| NY PM | 13:30 |

---

## Micro Cycles (22.5 minutes)

Each 90-minute quarter divides into four 22.5-minute micro quarters.

---

## Yearly Cycle

| Quarter | Months |
|---------|--------|
| Q1 | January - March |
| Q2 | April - June |
| Q3 | July - September |
| Q4 | October - December |

**Yearly True Open:** 1st Monday of April

---

## Monthly Cycle

Four one-week quarters, starting from first full week.

**Monthly True Open:** 2nd Monday of the month

---

## Trading Session Strategies

Based on how quarters unfold:

1. **Asia Range, London Manipulation, NY Reversal**
2. **Asia Expansion, London Consolidation, NY Continuation**
3. **Asia Range, London Expansion, NY Consolidation**
4. **Search & Destroy** (chop, no clear direction)
