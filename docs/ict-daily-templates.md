## I. Classic Buy/Sell Day

**High-probability wide-range trending day**

- Occurs: Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday
- Trend starts: London session
- Duration: 7-8 hours, usually lasts into 11:00 EST
- NY session: offers retracement for trend continuation

### Buy Scenario
1. Look for drop to key support (buy below opening price)
2. If price initially trades above open, wait for it to trade below
3. Fast moves to support preferred
4. Distance from open to support: typically 15-30 pips
5. If move exceeds 30 pips in London → wait for NY trade
6. Take small profit (20-30 pips) at 12:00

### Sell Scenario
- Mirror of buy template

## II. London Swing to Z Day

**Narrow range day - trend exhausted**

- Occurs: Often on Thursday
- Appears: After 2-3 days of big moves
- Behavior: Price drops below open, rallies above, consolidates back into range

### Trading
- After large explosive move, expect pause
- If price consolidates, do NOT look for continuation into NY
- Take profits early

## III. London Swing to NY Open / London Close Reversal

**Key Reversal Day**

### Bullish Version
1. Starts like Classic Buy Day - decline below opening price
2. Buy entry forms after drop
3. Price rallies to HTF Point of Interest (POI)
4. NY session reversal: rallies to high, then runs back down to clear initial low
5. Expect consolidation at 18:00 GMT or later

### Purpose
- Reach for bearish order block
- Turtle soup raid
- Close a range

---

## IV. Range to NY Open / London Close Rally

**News-driven template**

- Occurs: High/medium impact news days
- Asian + London: consolidation ahead of news
- After news: price explodes into directional move

### Pattern
1. Price stays in consolidation during Asian and London
2. Lows cleared initially
3. After news release, price rallies

### Tips
- Common during: NFP, FOMC, Interest Rate announcements
- Watch cross pairs - if majors consolidate but crosses move, wait for crosses to hit key S/R

---

## V. Consolidation Raid on News Release

**NY session high-impact news template**

- Old highs AND lows of prior consolidation taken out during/after news
- Signals can form within 5 minutes after news release

### Trading
1. Buy when low is taken out
2. Sell when prior high is breached
3. After open, market consolidates before news
4. Price drops to induce traders and take stops
5. After stop hunt, price moves in true direction
6. Identify key support/order block
7. Watch for price rejection within 5 min after news

### Common events
- NFP
- FOMC
- Interest Rate announcements

---

## VI. London Swing to Seek & Destroy

**Unprofitable template - avoid trading**

- Market Makers clear intention: take out both buyers AND sellers
- London Open setup won't come to fruition
- Narrow range zig-zag, often creates inside day
- Lasts through NY session
- Appears: End of larger price swing

### Trading Advice
- Better to trade when pair is in middle of range
- Avoid trading at support/resistance during this template
- "This day won't make you money"
