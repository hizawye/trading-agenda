# ICT Market Structure & Liquidity Concepts

## Price Action Elements

### The 4 States of Price
1. **Consolidation** - Sideways range, accumulation
2. **Expansion** - Directional move, distribution
3. **Retracement** - Pullback into range
4. **Reversal** - Direction change after rejection

**Key Rule**: Price always moves from Consolidation → Expansion

## Liquidity

### Types of Liquidity

| Type | Location | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Buy-Side Liquidity (BSL)** | Above highs | Buy stops, breakout orders |
| **Sell-Side Liquidity (SSL)** | Below lows | Sell stops, breakdown orders |
| **External Range Liquidity** | Swing highs/lows | Major targets |
| **Internal Range Liquidity** | FVGs, OBs | Retracement targets |

### Liquidity Flow
```
External Liquidity Taken → Displacement → Internal Liquidity → External Liquidity
     (stop hunt)              (move)         (retracement)      (next target)
```

## PD Arrays (Premium/Discount Arrays)

### Premium Arrays (Sell from)
- Order Blocks (Bearish)
- Fair Value Gaps (in premium)
- Breaker Blocks
- Rejection Blocks
- Mitigation Blocks

### Discount Arrays (Buy from)
- Order Blocks (Bullish)
- Fair Value Gaps (in discount)
- Breaker Blocks
- Rejection Blocks
- Mitigation Blocks

### Equilibrium
- **50% of any range** = Equilibrium
- Above 50% = Premium (look to sell)
- Below 50% = Discount (look to buy)

## Key PD Array Types

### Order Block
Last up-close candle before down move (bearish OB)
Last down-close candle before up move (bullish OB)

### Fair Value Gap (FVG)
3-candle pattern with gap between candle 1 high and candle 3 low (or inverse)

### Breaker Block
Failed order block that gets violated, then acts as support/resistance

### Rejection Block
Long wicks showing rejection at a level

### Vacuum Block
Gap created by volatility event (news)

## Market Structure

### Structure Elements
- **Swing High**: Higher high with lower highs on both sides
- **Swing Low**: Lower low with higher lows on both sides
- **BOS** (Break of Structure): Confirms trend continuation
- **MSS** (Market Structure Shift): Signals potential reversal
- **CHoCH** (Change of Character): Early reversal sign

### Structure Flow
```
Bullish: HH → HL → HH → HL (healthy trend)
         ↓
      Fails to make HH, makes LL = MSS (bearish shift)

Bearish: LL → LH → LL → LH (healthy trend)
         ↓
      Fails to make LL, makes HH = MSS (bullish shift)
```

## SMT Divergence (Smart Money Technique)

When correlated pairs diverge:
- EURUSD makes higher high, but GBPUSD doesn't = bearish divergence
- DXY makes higher high, but EURUSD doesn't make lower low = bullish EURUSD

## IPDA Data Range Levels

### 20-40-60 Day Lookback
Mark these levels daily:
- 20-day high/low
- 40-day high/low
- 60-day high/low

Price targets these levels for liquidity sweeps.
